### About Me

I am a passionate and proficient software developer with a strong background in C++, C, Python, and Java. My experience extends to system programming on Linux, where I have developed efficient and robust solutions.

I have a deep understanding of Docker, which I have used to containerize applications, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments. My proficiency in database management, particularly with PostgreSQL, allows me to design, implement, and maintain complex data storage solutions.

In addition to my back-end skills, I have experience working with front-end technologies like React. I am capable of creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces that provide a seamless user experience.

I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills. I believe in writing clean, efficient code and I am committed to the best practices in software development.
